# AI Design-Driven Code Generator with Dynamic Advertising Capabilities

Welcome to the **AI Design-Driven Code Generator**! This application leverages the power of artificial intelligence to autonomously generate unique designs, code, and personalized functionality for web applications. Now integrated with dynamic advertising capabilities, it enables data-driven, adaptive ads that stand out in the competitive digital landscape.

## Key Features

- **Unique Design Creation**: AI-generated designs based on user inputs ensure every project is unique. Customize design elements like color schemes, typography, and layouts.
- **Figma & Webflow Integration**: Import assets and layouts directly, preserving unique styling and creating responsive code from Figma/Webflow.
- **Voice-Activated Functionality Generation**: Describe functionalities in plain language; the AI interprets and generates the required code and backend logic.
- **Dynamic Content in Google Web Designer**:
   - Enable Dynamic Content: Set up placeholders in Google Web Designer for data like images or text. Populate with data sources like Google Sheets or JSON feeds.
   - Map Data to Components: Connect placeholders to your dynamic data to vary content based on inputs, adding real-time responsiveness to your ads.
- **Generative Variations with JavaScript**: Customize ads with JavaScript functions that adjust elements like color themes, animations, and layouts for varied user experiences.
- **API Integration for Real-Time Data**: Bring in real-time data (e.g., weather, location) with external APIs, adjusting ad content accordingly.
- **Generative AI for Unique Content**:
   - Text Generation: Use OpenAI’s API to create dynamic ad copy on the fly.
   - Image Generation: Integrate with AI image generators like DALL-E for adaptive visuals.
- **Programmatic Advertising with DV360**:
   - Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO): Connect to platforms like Google DV360 for automated ad variant display based on user data and behavior.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Built with React for a responsive, intuitive UI.
- **Backend**: Node.js server with AI-powered code and functionality generation.
- **AI Models**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and NLP models for design uniqueness and functionality.
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code’s Monaco Editor for seamless code creation.
- **Containerization**: Docker for deployment, with Kubernetes for scalability.
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 and encrypted data storage for privacy compliance.
- **Dynamic Content Tools**: Google Web Designer and DV360 for real-time, contextual ad delivery.
